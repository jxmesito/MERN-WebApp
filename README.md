Backend (Node.js, Express, MongoDB Atlas):

Use Node.js and Express to build the server-side component of your application. Express will handle routing, middleware, and API endpoints.
Connect to MongoDB Atlas, a cloud-hosted MongoDB database, to store and retrieve data.
Implement the necessary logic for handling requests, interacting with the database, and serving data to the frontend.

Frontend (React):

Set up a separate frontend using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
Create React components to represent different parts of your application's UI, such as navigation, forms, and data displays.
Use React's state management to handle user interactions and data updates within the frontend.
Communicate with the backend API (built with Node.js and Express) to fetch and update data from the MongoDB Atlas database.
Render dynamic content using EJS templates within your React components when needed.
