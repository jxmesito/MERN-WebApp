Backend (Node.js, Express, MongoDB Atlas):

We used Node.js and Express to build the server-side component of our application. Express handled routing, middleware, and API endpoints.
Then, we connected to MongoDB Atlas, a cloud-hosted MongoDB database, to store and retrieve data.
Finally, we implemented the necessary logic for handling requests, interacting with the database, and serving data to the frontend.

Frontend (React):

We set up a separate frontend using React components to represent different parts of our application's UI, such as navigation, forms, and data displays.
React's state management handled user interactions and data updates within the frontend. Our application communicates with the backend API (built with Node.js and Express) to fetch and update data from the MongoDB Atlas database. We then render the dynamic content using EJS templates within our React components when needed.
